## Description
This concept for this project was born out of the problem of international Covid-19 travel restrictions preventing people from visiting collections held by various public institutions and being able to discover art in person.  We further developed the concept as we discussed the lockdowns in Melbourne - people had more time at home to develop a hobby or their artistic skills but the restrictions caused many to lose motivation.  We wanted to offer a range of inspiring pieces from a diverse range of artworks, tailored to budding or practising artist.  It was also a good chance to draw data from a number of third party APIs and to learn how to collaborate on a development project with a new team.

## Installation
Open the (index.html) page in your prefered browser to see the website showing a large range of options to choose from.

## Usage
Once the (index.html) page in the prefered browser has opened, the user selects from a number of art styles/media/eras they are interested in plus a color palette and they submit their choices.  The user will be presented with a mosaic style page with a number of unique pieces of art.  The user can choose any of these to click through to a page showing them more information about the artist and the piece.  An additional page will show the user a history of their favourite pieces of art.
