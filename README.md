## Description
The concept for this project developed following a discussion about the situation in Melbourne during Covid-19 lockdowns - people had more time at home to develop a hobby or their artistic skills but the restrictions caused many to lose motivation.  We wanted to offer a range of inspiring pieces from a diverse range of artworks, tailored to budding or practising artist.  It was also a good chance to draw data from a number of third party APIs and to learn how to collaborate on a development project with a new team.

## Installation
Open the (index.html) page in your prefered browser to see the website showing a large range of options to choose from.

## Usage
Once the (index.html) page in the prefered browser has opened, the user selects from a number of art styles/media/eras they are interested in plus a color palette and they submit their choices.  The user will be presented with a mosaic style page with a number of unique pieces of art.  The user can choose any of these to click through to a page showing them more information about the artist and the piece.  An additional page will show the user a history of their favourite pieces of art.
